This project gives two options for use HTML 4.01 tags with CakePHP's HTMLHelper.

The first it's documented in CakePHP Book [1], access the URL for more information.

The second it's a suggestion made by Juan Basso in the comments area of Kiss blog [2]. It's the HTML4Helper, that extends HTMLHelper and overwrites the XHTML tags with HTML tags, and changes the default doctype to HTML 4.01 Strict, a recomendation from W3C.
